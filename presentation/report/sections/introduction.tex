\section{Introduction}
In NASA's Mars 2020 mission, the helicopter \textit{Ingenuity} was deployed to demonstrate the first powered flight on another planet. The helicopter was designed to be a technology demonstrator, and its main goal was to prove that powered flight in the thin Martian atmosphere is possible. By the date of the end of its mission (caused by the rupture of one of the rotor blades), Ingenuity had far exceeded every expectation: originally designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days, instead it flew for almost three years, performing 72 flights, and traversing more than 14 times the planned distance.

In the upcoming sections of the document we will present a mathematical model of Ingenuity, and we will discuss the control strategies that can be used to stabilize and control it, possibly around a planned trajectory, during flight in the Martian atmosphere. The theoretical results will be validated through simulated experiments.
