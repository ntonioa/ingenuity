\section{Mathematical model}
Each of the two rotors of Ingenuity generates a thrust vector in a commanded direction, which is applied on the rotating hub. Not only does this result in a force capable of moving the helicopter, but it also generates a torque that can be used to control its orientation. \\The helicopter is treated as a simple rigid body without taking into account the aerodynamics of the blades, therefore the only external force is gravity. 

From now on, we will consider an inertial reference frame (superscript $^i$) and a non-inertial one attached to the drone body (superscript $^b$). \\ The relative orientation of the latter with respect to the former is expressed in roll, pitch and yaw angles (i.e. the three components of $W$), or alternatively through the corresponding rotation matrix (in compact trigonometric notation with $\sin(W_i) = s_i$ and $\cos(W_i) = c_i$):
\begin{align*}
    R(W) = R = \begin{bmatrix}
        c_2 c_1& s_2 s_1 c_3 - s_1 c_3 & s_3 s_2 c_1 + s_1 s_3 \\
        c_2 s_3 & s_2 s_1 s_3 + c_3 c_1 & s_3 s_2 c_1 - s_1 c_3 \\
        -s_2 & s_1 c_2 & c_2 c_1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
