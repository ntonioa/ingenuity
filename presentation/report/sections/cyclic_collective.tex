\section{ cyclic and collective pitch}
In this section we will tackle the problem at the third and lowest level of abstraction, taking into account the lift and drag force contribution of each airfoil of infinitesimal width that composes a rotor blade, and modeling both the cyclic and collective pitches of all the blades. This is done so that the module of the thrust moving Ingenuity can be controlled not only through the rotation speed of the blades (which is usually kept constant during flight), but also by acting on the collective pitch of the two rotors.
