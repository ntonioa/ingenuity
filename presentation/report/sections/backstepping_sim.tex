\subsection{Simulation results} 
The backstepping controller was also tested on the a trajectory tracking task akin to the one seen in Section \ref{sec:fbl_sim}. The reference trajectory is expressed in \ref{eq:pos_ref} and \ref{eq:yaw_ref}, with the same parameters $r = \qty{5}{\meter}$, $d = 5$ and $k = 10$. 
\\With the current controller, which is far more robust than of the previous one, we can also afford to start from an initial condition corresponding to a nonzero initial tracking error, i.e., the origin.

The comparison between the reference and the actual trajectory of Ingenuity is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BS_trajectory}. Notice that the robot is able to follow the desired path with a good approximation, while recovering both the initial position error and the final one (generated by the abrupt change in the reference).

As theoretically expected, the controller exploits the roll and pitch dynamics to impart the desired behavior to the remainder of the system (see Figure \ref{fig:BS_attitude}).

Finally, the necessary control inputs, adequately saturated according to the constraints \ref{eq:omega_u_constraint} - \ref{eq:beta_constraint} so as to reflect the actual physical limitations of the actuators, are depicted in Figures \ref{fig:BS_angles} and \ref{fig:BS_omega}. 
\\ We can therefore state that the controller is not only robust to external disturbances, but also to these types of constraints.
