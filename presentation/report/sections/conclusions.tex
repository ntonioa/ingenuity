\section{Conclusions}
The Mars helicopter \textit{Ingenuity} is a complex system that requires careful modeling and control design to ensure its stability and performance. In this paper, we have presented a detailed mathematical model of the helicopter dynamics during flight through the Martian atmosphere, and then used it to design an input-output feedback linearization controller and a backstepping controller to stabilize it around a desired trajectory. As a result, the following conclusions can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ingenuity is an underactuated system with four control inputs and six degrees of freedom, whose dynamics are highly nonlinear and depend on the altitude, the rotor speed, and the blade pitch angles. The model we have developed captures these dependencies and provides a good approximation of the real system behavior.
    \item The input-output feedback linearization controller is able to stabilize the positional and yaw dynamics of Ingenuity around a desired trajectory, but the hidden nonlinearities respond to the control inputs in an undesired and unrealistic way. This is due to the fact that the controller does not take into account the coupling between the different states of the system.
    \item The backstepping controller, on the other hand, is able to stabilize the full dynamics of Ingenuity because it accounts for the cascade-like inner structure of the system and exploits it by recursively designing virtual control laws and stabilizing error dynamics at deeper levels within the system, gradually steering it towards the goal.
