\subsection{Actuator dynamics}
The control signals $\omega_u$, $\omega_l$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not instantly translated into the corresponding angular velocities or swashplate tilt angles: non-idealities arise since the physical components of Ingenuity are set in motion by actuators (typically electrical motors). \\
In reality, often actuators integrate low-level closed loops (sometimes even analog, e.g. through potentiometers) whose dynamics may be overlooked in the high-level control system design.
To account for the effect of these components in our model and simulations, however, it is appropriate to model each of the four input channels as double integrators:
\begin{align*}
    G_i(s) = \frac{1}{s^2}, \quad i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
\end{align*}
In feedforward, the trivial solution is to control the double integrators with (physically realizable) controllers such as:
\begin{align*}
    K_i(s) = \frac{s^2}{(1 + s \, T_i)^2}, \quad i = 1, 2, 3, 4,
\end{align*}
with $T_i$ being a (small enough) time constant that can be tuned to match the actual dynamics of the actuators. \\
This means that, at the end of the day, the resulting actuator open-loop transfer functions are equal to:
\begin{align*}
    L_i(s) = G_i(s) \, K_i(s) = \frac{1}{(1 + s \, T_i)^2}, \quad i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
\end{align*}
