    This paper details the process of developing a control system for Ingenuity, a drone helicopter that operated from 2021 to 2024 on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. Said process consists first of creating a mathematical model capable of representing the behavior of the drone in flight over Mars, and then designing a controller capable of imparting desired behavior and performance (trajectory tracking) to the model. 
    The problem is approached through two different control strategies: first, with a static input-to-output feedback linearization controller, and then, through the backstepping technique. Among the two, only the latter returns satisfactory results, as it is able to achieve the objectives by exploiting the fact that Ingenuity is an underactuated robot.
